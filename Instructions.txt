Read me file for Machine Learning course project.

File descriptions:
-ML_Project_ABRAHAM_PACIELLO.pdf:: PDF report of project
-eda.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis file
-preprocessing.ipynb: Preprocessing methods developed here
-preprocessor.py: File used to conduct final preprocessing on data
-modelling.ipynb: Modelling conducted here
-SWEETVIZ_REPORT.html: EDA html file, open for detailed EDA on all variables (see Section 2.5 in the report)
-./data: Directory including files: cup98LRN.txt (raw data file), preprocessed_data.csv
-./eval: Directory including files: logistic_regression_eval.csv (results of hyperparameter tuning, i.e. parameters used and CV scores

Instructions to reproduce results:
1. Run preprocessor.py in terminal using command: "python preprocessor.py train <path_to_data>"
2. Run the modelling notebook inserting the correct path to the preprossed_data.csv (this file is created in ./data folder)

For a more easily understandable preprocessing steps please refer to preprocessor.ipynb, here all steps are laid out with commments and explanations.

N.B. The modelling notebook may take a long time to run due to the gridsearch hyperparameter tuning.
